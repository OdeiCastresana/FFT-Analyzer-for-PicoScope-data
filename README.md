# FFT-Analyzer-for-PicoScope-data
This file was generated for the purpose of the life estimation of a Snubber Network (R-C), which is part of a half bridge inverter power module rated for 1200V &amp; 600A. 
Developed .m file extracts relevant data (DC voltage, Max, Min, RMS AC, etc.) and plots current and voltage FFTs for the life estimation. The processed data is a .csv from PicoScope.
